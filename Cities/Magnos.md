> Magnos is known as The City of Ingenuity and is well known across the [[Mortal Continent]] as the birthplace of [[Magitech]] and for it's innovations that bring comfort and quality of life to the people who reside there.
#### About
Magnos is the home of the Dwarven people and is a sprawling and breathtaking underground marvel of technology. You will see many inexplicable things here such as the famous [[Magikart Racing]], [[Magitech]] devices use for large scale drilling and excavating operations, and ways of communication over large distances without the need of a spell. Magnos is also home to the [[Black Rock Mining Company]], the [[Magma-stone Forge]], and [[Volt Labs]] which contain some of the most brilliant minds, and toughest workers you'll ever meet.
#### Famous citizens
There is one famous citizen named [[Arnos Volgrim]] who is a descendant of the founder of [[Magitech]] and is just as much of a magitech genius as his predecessor.
#### World Views
- The dwarven people typically view people who use magic as archaic and inefficient
- Humans they view as allies although not that smart compared to their genius
- Elves they view as rivals of sorts since they use magic mainly due to their deep affinity for it and since the dwarven can't use magic there is somewhat jealousy mixed in
- Tieflings they view as interesting, and that they could possibly provide new information since their kin are from the demon continent
#### Typical Quest Types
Most quests you will find in the dwarven city are revolving around retrieving [[Isekai-Earth/Crafting Mats/Ores]], or [[Artifacts]] from the [[Black Rock Mine]] dungeon for various citizens and companies.
#### Dungeon
> The Dungeon that this city is built around is known as the [[Black Rock Mine]] and has served as a source of ancient knowledge, and earthen resources for as far back as anyone can remember.

Black Rock Mine, just like the other [[Dungeons]], has very little information about how it was formed or how deep it really goes. It is very cavernous, somewhat damp at levels 10 and below, and resembles a traditional mine but is suspected to extend down for miles into the earth. There is a plethora of different ores located in the mines with Copper being prominent on floors 1-10, Iron on floors 11-25, Mithril on floors 26-50, with little known what may lie deeper. Floor 50 is the deepest that any expedition has traversed due to a [Colossus](https://5e.tools/bestiary/colossus-xmm.html) being present that defends the passageway down.
###### Explored areas
Any explored areas up to Floor 50 have been lit up by [[Magitech]] Lanterns. If you come across any areas that are not illuminated in the soft blue glow of the lanterns proceed with caution.
###### Monster Types
The Monsters who inhabit this dungeon are mostly [[Isekai-Earth/Monsters/Monster Types/Constructs]] by nature.
