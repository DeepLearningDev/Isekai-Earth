> Magnos is known as The City of Ingenuity and is well known across the [[Mortal Continent]] as the birthplace of [[Magitech]] and for it's innovations that bring comfort and quality of life to the people who reside there.

#### About
Magnos is the home of the Dwarven people and is a sprawling and breathtaking underground marvel of technology.

Magnos is also home to the [[Black Rock Mining Company]], the [[Magma-stone Forge]], and [[Volt Labs]] which contain some of the most brilliant minds, and toughest workers you'll ever meet.

#### Famous citizens
There is one famous citizen named [[Arnos Volgrim]] who is a descendant of the founder of [[Magitech]] and is just as much of a magitech genius as his predecessor.
#### World Views
- The dwarven people typically view people who use magic as archaic and inefficient.
- Humans they view as allies although not that smart compared to their genius
- Elves they view as rivals of sorts since they use magic mainly due to their deep affinity for it and since the dwarven can't use magic there is somewhat jealousy mixed in.
- Tieflings they view as interesting, and that they could possibly provide new information since their kin are from the demon continent.
